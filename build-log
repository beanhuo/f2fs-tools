1. firstly follow the steps which are introduced by https://github.com/jaegeuk/f2fs-tools
2. However, even though, you still cannot successfully cross-compile.
   a. The first issue I encountered is that it cannot find libselinux1, to fix
   this issue, just add this in the configure command:

   --without-selinux

   b. then the second issue I met that cannot find libuuid-dev
   Based on the README in the f2fs-tool folder, which suggests several depended
   package, but it doesn't say these depended package are for arm-gcc or host
   gcc. for the cross-compile, we should install uuid lib for your own arm-gcc.

   If you have ever built the mtd-util tool, then you will know the steps of
   compile/install libuuid lib:

   wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/files/e2fsprogs/v1.42.9/e2fsprogs-1.42.9.tar.gz

   tar -xzf e2fsprogs-1.42.9.tar.gz
   cd e2fsprogs-1.42.9

   ./configure CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc --host=arm-linux-gnueabi --prefix=your
   cross-gcc tool lib folder
    make
    make install
    cd lib/uuid/
    make install

    then, you will see a file libuuid.a in your gcc lib folder.

    c. After above operations, seems we fix all the problems, but while performing
    make command, there is this issue:

    "build failed, dangerous relocation: unsupported relocation"

    This is because of library build needs -fPIC,
    then we add fPIC in the libuuid configure command:

    sudo ./configure CFLAGS='-fPIC' --host=arm-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/

    after this, rebuild the libuuid, and install,
    then you will finally compile the f2fs-tool.
